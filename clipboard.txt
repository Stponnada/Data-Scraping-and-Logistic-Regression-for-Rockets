#an interesting thing to notice in this data is that for any row that has NaN in the operator and orbit, the entire row is empty. Such rows can be deleted.
df_clean = df_clean.dropna(subset=['Operator','Outcome'])
#drop rows with NaN (hence drop-na). But dont check all rows. Check only those with columns - operator and outcome as NaN

df_clean.reset_index(drop=True).head()
#after the drop has been done, reset the index, since some lines have been deleted
